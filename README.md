##  Site Expansion Ideas
---

Features that could be added to expand and improve the website in the future.

### Search feature 
* enable users to search for a blog by part/all of the title/blog number/posted date
* would have a search icon that when clicked on would expand a search bar and make suggestions based on what the user typed (from the possible options of blogs)
* would probably use JS?

### Login/Sign up
* allows users to have a basic 'account' (not necesary to have profile image or data or anything)
* saves their data to a database and validates it from there
* allows them to write comments 

### Writing comments on blogs
* this feature is disabled unless the user is logged in
* could have an email API to alert Josh each morning (emails sent by time) of how many comments were made and on which blogs

### Email notifications
* setup API to notify users when a new blog is posted
* if this costs money, then encourage them to follow the Insta account instead
